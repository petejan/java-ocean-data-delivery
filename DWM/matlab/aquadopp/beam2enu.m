function Venu=Beam2ENU(Vbeam,heading,pitch,roll,ornt);
% function Venu=Beam2ENU(Vbeam,T,heading,pitch,roll,up)
%
% Beam2ENU transforms beam data to ENU coordinates. 
% This version assumes that the heading, pitch and roll are fixed.
%
% Vbeam is the 3D velocity in beam coordinates. Array can be in 
% rows or columns as long as the number of data points is >3. 
% 
% T is the transformation matrix for beam to xyz coordinates, 
% Examples 
% T = [6461 -3232 -3232; 0 -5596 5596; 1506 1506 1506]; % profiler 
% T = [2896 2896 0; -2896 2896 0; -2896 -2896 5792]; % std current meter 
% 
% heading, pitch and roll are all in degrees 
% ornt==0 if the instrument points up, ornt==1 if down
